			     Version 2.2.0


OVERVIEW

This is the Extended Module Player, an open source module player for UNIX
distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL. xmp currently runs on several
platforms, including Linux with ALSA and OSS, SunOS, NetBSD, HP-UX, OS/2,
FreeBSD and Solaris. On PC class machines with GUS or AWE cards xmp takes
advantage of the  OSS sequencer to play modules  with virtually no system
load.  Using software mixing, xmp plays at rates up to 48 kHz with 32 bit
linear interpolation.

Modules  compressed  with  gzip, bzip2,  compress, MO3, MMCMP, Powerpack,
SQSH  or ADPCM samples (used in MDZ files) are handled transparently, and
the first  file in a zip or lha archive will be played (the  zip unpacker
skips files with non-module suffixes like .com, .exe, .diz or .txt common
in DOS archives). Some loaders  (mostly packed mods) check the file  size
before playing so they will not recognize modules inside a multi-file zip
or lha archive. To read MO3 files, you  must have unmo3 installed, get it
from http://www.un4seen.com/.

Impulse Tracker filter envelopes and  Imago Orpheus chorus/reverb effects
are now supported using AWE cards with the OSS sequencer.  Many thanks to
Davi Lima for donating an AWE card!

The latest version and bug tracker are available at http://xmp.sf.net.


SUPPORTED FORMATS

xmp 2.0 tries to  accurately  emulate Protracker, Fast Tracker II, Scream
Tracker 3 and Impulse Tracker event handling algorithms to play M.K., XM,
S3M and IT modules. By default, Sound/Noise/Protracker modules are played
in  Protracker 3.15 style  and  multichannel mutations in Fast Tracker II
style -- see doc/README.trackers for details. Multifile formats must have
all files in the same directory (ALM, Protracker songs, Startrekker AM).

The current version recognizes the following module formats:

FRONT-ENDS

xmp can be used stand-alone, as a plugin for BMP or XMMS or as a back-end
for GQmpeg, xhippo and others. Get them in the following URLs:

  BeepMP:  http://beepmp.sf.net
  XMMS:    http://xmms.org
  GQmpeg:  http://www.netpedia.net/hosting/gqview/mpeg-index.html
  xhippo:  http://freshmeat.net/projects/gnuxhippo/homepage/

WARNING: When using the XMMS plugin, it's advisable to disable the mikmod
plugin (otherwise XMMS may get confused and eventually crash).


OUTPUT DRIVERS

xmp can play through a number of different output drivers.  Currently the
follwing devices are supported:

  Name		Description

  aix		AIX audio library (not tested, possibly broken)
  alsa_mix	Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) PCM
  arts		aRts (KDE sound server)
  bsd		BSD generic audio device
  dart		OS/2 Direct Audio Real Time (DART)
  esd		Enlightened Sound Daemon
  file		File/stdout output
  hpux		HP-UX audio device
  irix		IRIX audio library
  netbsd	NetBSD audio device
  nas		Network Audio System (NAS)
  openbsd	OpenBSD audio device
  oss_mix	Open Sound System (OSS) PCM
  oss_seq	Open Sound System (OSS) sequencer
  qnx		QNX audio device
  solaris	Solaris audio device (linear and ulaw)
  win32		Win32 sound (experimental -- not tested)
  xmms		XMMS sound drivers (using the XMMS plugin)

The drivers can be statically built into the player or dinamically linked
if the OS supports dlopen.  Modular drivers are  useful to reduce package
dependencies in vendor-bundled packages.


INTERACTIVE COMMANDS

The following single key commands can be used during the playback.  Click
on the volume bars in xxmp to mute channels. (Please read the manual page
for description of the command line arguments recognized by xmp.)

	'q' 		=>	quit the player
	'f'		=>	jump to next pattern
	'b'		=>	jump to previous pattern
	'n'		=>	jump to next module
	'p'		=>	jump to previous module
	SPACE		=>	pause
	'1' to '0'	=>	mute/unmute channels 1 to 10
	'!'		=>	unmute all channels
	'm' (xxmp)	=>	cycle through display modes

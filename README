			     Version 2.2.0


OVERVIEW

This is the Extended Module Player, a module player for Unix-like systems
that runs on Linux with ALSA and OSS, SunOS, NetBSD, HP-UX, OS/2, FreeBSD
and Solaris. Xmp plays over 60 mainstream and obscure module formats from
Amiga, Atari, Acorn and PC.

Many compressed module formats are supported, including popular Unix, DOS
and Amiga file packers such as gzip, bzip2, SQSH, Powerpack, etc. Certain
module-specific compressed formats such as MO3 are handled transparently.


SUPPORTED FORMATS

xmp 2.2 tries to  accurately  emulate Protracker, Fast Tracker II, Scream
Tracker 3 and Impulse Tracker event handling algorithms to play M.K., XM,
S3M and IT modules. By default, Sound/Noise/Protracker modules are played
in  Protracker 3.15 style  and  multichannel mutations in Fast Tracker II
style -- see doc/README.trackers for details. Multifile formats must have
all files in the same directory (ALM, Protracker songs, Startrekker AM).

The current version recognizes the following module formats:

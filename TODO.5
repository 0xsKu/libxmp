- envelope pool like digitrakker
  * allows envelope setting effect in digitrakker
  * saves memory

- add support for extra fine volume slides
  * used in digitrakker

- add support to sample rate to decouple period/pitch
  * needed to adjust MED IFFOCT octave offset
  * needed to properly map IT samples
  * rate affects period flag per sample

- add missing IT fields to instrument/sample
  * random pan variation
  * sample sustain loop

- true bidirectional sample loop processing
  * saves memory used to unroll loops
  * saves memory used to unroll sustain loops

- remove direct access to strucutre pointers

- lower MIN_BPM to 10

- fix CFLAGS mess

- alloc buffer externally?

- flags and mixer info in frame_info
  * to check if classic mixers are in use
